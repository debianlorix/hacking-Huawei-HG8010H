# hacking-huawei-HG8010H
Starting from the awesome guide of https://github.com/logon84, because I need to modding the firmware of
my Huawei HG8010H, unfortunately this huge firm doesn't allow to download software update to users.

The main reason is that I want use this ONT with my fiber optic ISP, just to replace my very hot SFP module. The problem is that my ONT doesn't match with the OLT, it refuse to establish connection.
